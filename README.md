# Moringa-Core-Week-4-IP
Working as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company, the aim is to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset. Towards this end, I will be investigating the following null and alternative hypothesis:

Null Hypothesis: The mean number of bluecars taken over the weekend is the same as the mean number of bluecars taken over the weekday

Alternative Hypothesis: The mean number of bluecars taken over the weekend is greater than the mean number of bluecars taken over the weekday
